    "Bias shows how far away the assumptions made in the model are from the truth. (High Bias - Underfitting)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance shows how much the estimate changes based on different sets of data. (High Variance - Overfitting)<br>\n",

    "Example: You ask someone for a weather forecast who is always assuming that it will rain and someone who knows when it will rain in a few particular cases. The first will generally predict rather bad but consistently that it will surely rain , while the second person will have problems predicting the weather for cases that are outside of his knowledge range."

    "y = mx + b + error (with m being the slope,  b the intercept (y-value at x=0) and error the residual, i.e. the variance in y which cannot be explained by the linear regression model).\n",

    "The model is usually fit by the Ordinary Least Sqaures (OLS) algorithm, which minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE), also called residual sum of squares (RSS), i.e. the squared distance between the actual y value and the model-predicted y value (y-hat). "

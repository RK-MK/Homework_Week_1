    "# The bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in simple terms, the bias-variance tradeoff describes the tradeoff between flexibility (i.e. complexity / degrees of freedom) of the model and how well it performs on unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of any machine learning algorithm is always to perform well on unseen data. Or to put it in more formalistic terms: one has to minimize the expected <strong>test</strong> mean squared error (or any other metric of success that one is using).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different errors control the test MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias error: Is an effect of underfitting. It results from errornous assumptions in the model. E.g.: Trying to fit a sinusodial function with a straight line while result in a large bias error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance error: Is an effect of overfitting. model is sensitive to small fluctuations in training data . If we again look at the example of a sinusodial function, a degree 20 polynomial fit will result in a low bias (because it fits the training data very well). However, the ability to \"react\" to changes in the data and thus perform well on unseen data is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Online banking fraud detection system which tracks and analyses mouse movement of the user. If the underlying algorithm ius optimized using only the training data (e.g. the user is always in the same setting, setting at the same desk, using the same mouse etc.), it will fail when he or she uses a different computer (e.g. with a trackpad)."

    "Basicly we want to fit a model that works good on unseen data. If we generate a model that fits the trainingdata perfectly, we overfit the model that means we have a complex model with high variance and low bias. But our model will follow every noise in the training data and therefore will perform bad on unseen data.\n",
    "If we build a simple model with high bias and low variance our model will underfit the data, so it will perform bad on unseen data aswell. \n",
    "So our goal is to find a model with a good balance between bias and variance, so our model will work good for unseen data."

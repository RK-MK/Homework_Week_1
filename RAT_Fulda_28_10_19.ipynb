    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a quantitative example (not like a classification) to find a correlation between y and x variables. When y rises x does so as well. Y is the dependent variable and x (or many x, see question 2) the independent variable. If you then plot these points against each other in a scatter plot you can calculate a best fit line based on the formula y = m*x + b, where m is the slope and b the y-intercept. You need to minimize the sum of all square errors, which is the distance of all x points to the best fit line (residuals). Than you have to calculate the least square regression to find the best fit line, this will be your prediction line."

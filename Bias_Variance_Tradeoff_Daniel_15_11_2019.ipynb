    "# Bias Variance Tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and Variance are measures for how well a statistical model performs in prediction or classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias describes the tendency of a model to be skewed, leaned, biased into a certain direction, away from the optimal \"direction of aim\" . Less flexible models (small degrees of freedom) tend to have a high bias as they are constrained in their adaptation abilities to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is a measure of how flexibly a model adjusts to training data, how strong its fit varies with the data it is fed/fitted with. Slightly altering the training data will lead to a rather large difference in the model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less flexible models have a low variance, but can have a high bias (underfitting). More flexible models have low bias, but can have a high variance (overfitting). The opposing nature of the variation of bias and variance with model complexity is called the Bias-Variance-Tradeoff. Finding a model which simultaneously has low bias and low variance is the objective of statistical learning efforts. "

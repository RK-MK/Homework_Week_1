    "### Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating)\n",
    "Bagging aggregates the estimates from multiple individual models **trained in parallel to reduce variance**, whereby each individual model is based on a random sample of the data with replacement. Aggregation of estimates is achieved by averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification) of individual model predictions. "

    "### Boosting\n",
    "Boosting makes predictions based on several individual models, which are **trained sequentially** on weighted versions of the data, whereby more weight is given to examples which were misclassified in previous rounds, which leads to a stepwise **reduction in bias**. Final predictions are made using a weighted sum (for regression) or a weighted majority vote (for classification)."

    "Stacking combines multiple models (classifier or regressors) into a meta-classifier or meta-predictor. First, base-level models are trained on the data, then the outputs/predictions of these base-level models are used as new features to train a higher-level (meta) model. For example, predictions from three base-level models (KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) can be combined by a Logistic Regression meta-classifier to **improve predictive power**."

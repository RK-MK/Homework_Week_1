    "The \"bias-variance tradeoff\" in Machine Learning describes the trade-off between model flexibility and model generizability: \n",
    "- A model with high **bias** has a high difference between predicted and true data - it is *underfitted*. \n",
    "- A model with high **variance** is so adapted to the training data that it does not generalize to new data / environments - it is *overfitted*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias/variance trade-off refers to finding the \"right\" degree of model complexity for the problem at hand, which will ensure that the model has both low bias and low variance."

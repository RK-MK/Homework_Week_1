    "The bias variance radeoff describes the problem of creating a model which is robust towards the training- as well as test-dataset. High variance expresses a high degree of freedom (expressed in the degree of the polynomial of the model) which leads to a high error rate when testing the model. High bias has a low degree of freedom with a propable low error rate. When defining a model, a tradeoff has to be found which allows for a general usage of the model. The stock market could serve as an example: utilizing historical data could lead to a potential very accurate, but overfitting model with high variance. High bias may lead to underfitting as the model is oversimplified: if a house only has one bathroom, it has to be cheap."
